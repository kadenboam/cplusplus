# Project Title (Update)

This proect is a D&D like program created using C++. It has characters, stats, monsters which are actually pretty tough as they run on the same stat system as players, etc.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Use Visual studio code
2. Create main program
3. To simplify program, seperate complex, big, or similar functions into classes with their own file referenced at the top of the main file.
4. Configure a dubugger in VSCode, or use the website https://www.onlinegdb.com/

Instructions for using the software:

1. Configure a dubugger in VSCode, or use the website by copying all files to the site: https://www.onlinegdb.com/
2. Enter desired username
3. Follow along with the prompts and make choices for your adventure. Be carful though as you can die and there will be game over.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* C++ extension on VSCode
* Configure a the debugger or just use debugging website
